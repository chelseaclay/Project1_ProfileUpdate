        <h2>Career Background</h2>
        <p>I am a graphic deisnger, looking to expand my knowledge in the digital space more. I had been lucky to obtain a bachelors degree and land my first job within a month of graduating. This position was a great opportunity to work within an internal agency for a fortune 500 company. My experience allowed me to work on various kinds of collateral. From spec sheets and user manuals, to designing and collaborating on campaigns, to product boards and trade show graphics. I have had the opportunity to support clients on a global scale.</p>
        <p>Although, the bulk of my work has been in the print realm, I realize more and more how important the digital aspect has become. Digital is a path that I have always been interested in and have actually worked on in my personal time before starting my Treehouse techdegree. I have an understanding of basic HTML with a little bit of CSS (thanks to <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com">CodeAcademy</a>.) I am able to take pre-made templates and understand it enough to manipulate the code for my personal use.</p>
        <p>I am beginning my journey with Treehouse in order to fask track this learning process. I am used to working in a fast-pased, deadline driven environment so anything personal learning tends to be put on the back burner at times. I am hoping Treehouse will give me a deeper understanding of the skills I am learning. Not only is it important to have these skills, but it is just as important to think more like a developer and hone your problem solving skills.</p>

        <h2>Personal Time</h2>
        <p>When my attention is not focused on work, my next priority is my beautiful husky puppy, Jasper. He is just a big ball of energy that really knows how to put a smile on my face. We are still working on his puppy mannors right now. In case you are not familiar with this breed, huskies are known to be <strong>very</strong> stubborn. He'll get with the program eventually. And when he does, I look into getting him a friend.</p>
